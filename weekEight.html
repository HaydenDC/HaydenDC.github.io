<h2>Object literal</h2>
<pre>
	   Creating an object in Javascript can be done as a 
	literal. This is very similar to an associative array.
	Just like with objects in other languages, we can use 
	the "." operator to call member properties of the object.

	var student = 
	{
		firstName: "Hayden", 
		lastName: "Carlson", 
		gender: "Male",
		year: "Senior",
		major: "Software Engineering"
	};	

	The result:
</pre>
<br>

<p id="lit"></p>
<script>
	//Create object literal
	var student = 
	{
		firstName: "Hayden", 
		lastName: "Carlson", 
		gender: "Male",
		year: "Senior",
		major: "Software Engineering"
};

    //Display object properties
    document.getElementById("lit").innerHTML = 
    "Name: " + student.firstName + " " +
    student.lastName + "<br>" +
    "Gender: " + student.gender + "<br>" +
    "Year: " + student.year + "<br>" +
    "Major: " + student.major + "<br>";


</script>
